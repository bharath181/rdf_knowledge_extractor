## Next Steps
1. Prioritize outreach to companies with scores above 80
2. Leverage warm relationships for introductions
3. Align messaging with identified pain points
4. Time engagement around contract renewal dates

### Recommended Actions for ACME Corporation:

**Immediate (This Week):**
- Schedule executive briefing with Sarah Chen before her December board presentation
- Prepare ROI analysis showing 40% TCO reduction
- Coordinate with David Thompson on API integration capabilities demo

**Short-term (Next 2 Weeks):**
- Arrange proof-of-concept focusing on AI-powered lead scoring for Jennifer Park's team
- Provide EU data compliance documentation to Robert Kim
- Set up technical deep-dive with Michael Rodriguez on microservices architecture

**Strategic Positioning:**
- Lead with integration simplification message - directly addresses their 15% efficiency loss
- Emphasize 3-month implementation timeline to meet Q1 2025 go-live requirement
- Highlight successful implementations with similar enterprise software companies
- Prepare competitive displacement strategy for Salesforce renewal in March 2025

### Custom Talking Points:

**For Sarah Chen (CEO):**
- "Your CloudNext keynote on Enterprise AI aligns perfectly with our native AI capabilities"
- "We can reduce your $2M annual technical debt while modernizing your stack"
- "Our solution delivers the real-time executive analytics you need for board reporting"

**For Michael Rodriguez (CTO):**
- "Our API-first, microservices architecture aligns with your 'Moving Beyond Monoliths' vision"
- "Native AWS integration means zero changes to your existing cloud infrastructure"
- "Our platform eliminates the integration complexity between your cloud platforms"

**For Jennifer Park (VP Sales Ops):**
- "Our AI-powered lead scoring will recover the 20% productivity loss from manual processes"
- "Real-time revenue operations dashboard built specifically for sales leaders"
- "3-month implementation means your team hits the ground running in Q1"

### Risk Mitigation:
- **Risk:** Current vendor relationships (especially Salesforce) may resist displacement
- **Mitigation:** Position as complementary initially, then expand footprint
- **Risk:** Security concerns from Robert Kim could delay decision
- **Mitigation:** Proactively provide SOC 2 Type II certification and EU compliance docs
- **Risk:** Integration complexity concerns from David Thompson
- **Mitigation:** Offer hands-on POC with their actual data and systems
